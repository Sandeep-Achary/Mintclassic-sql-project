SQL Data Analysis for Business Insights
Summary
Developed SQL queries to analyze business data, including inventory, sales, customer profiles, and employee performance, using aggregation, joins, and subqueries to derive actionable insights.

Solution
The project involved creating SQL queries to analyze key business aspects such as total stock, revenue, and sales performance by product, warehouse, and employee. It included profiling customers based on their orders and payments, calculating total revenue, and evaluating employee sales contributions. By leveraging SQL joins, aggregation, and subqueries, the queries provided detailed insights into product inventory, warehouse performance, and financial metrics, helping drive data-driven decisions.

Approach
The approach began with understanding business requirements, focusing on inventory management, sales, and customer profiling. SQL queries were designed to extract data from multiple tables using joins to aggregate and summarize information. Key techniques included GROUP BY for aggregation, LEFT JOINs to include all relevant data, and subqueries for complex calculations. The goal was to create flexible, reusable queries that provided in-depth insights into business operations, aiding decision-making.

Description
